EatUp uses Yelp Fusion API, Google Maps API, and the Geocoder gem. The backend is built on Rails and delivers JSON data to the frontend through a server-hosted API.

1) Fork and clone this repository. Run a 'bundle-install' in the directory.

2) Make sure you have PostgreSQL! Run 'rake db:setup' to get the database working.

3) Run 'rails s' to get the backend hosted on your local server
